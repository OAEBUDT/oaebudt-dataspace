# oaebudt-dataspace-backend

The backend connector is implemented as an extension of the [EDC Connector](https://github.com/eclipse-edc).  

You can find the source code for this extension in the repository under `connector/extensions/web-service`  :

[https://github.com/OAEBUDT/oaebudt-dataspace/tree/develop/connector/extensions/web-service](https://github.com/OAEBUDT/oaebudt-dataspace/tree/develop/connector/extensions/web-service)

This extension customizes and enhances the base EDC connector to support the specific requirements of the OAEBUDT dataspace.
